WoBubatz is a sophisticated, location-based event management platform designed to enhance community engagement through real-time interactive geofencing technology. It enables users to discover, create, and engage with local smoke meet-ups based on shared interests and location.

## Core Features

- **Geofencing Interactions:** Notifications upon approaching or leaving the vicinity of events.
- **Advanced Privacy Controls:** Customizable settings for meet-up visibility and personal location sharing.

## Functional Details

### Client-Side Functionality
- Local management of geofences to minimize server load and enhance user privacy.
- Immediate delivery of alerts and notifications based on user proximity to meet-ups.
- Streamlined user interface for effortless management of events and profile settings.

### Server-Side Functionality
- Secure handling of user authentication and sensitive data.
- Efficient processing and distribution of meet-up information.
- Real-time location analysis for accurate and relevant event dissemination.

### Event Accessibility & Privacy
- **Request-Approval Notification:** Meet-ups where all entrants are prompted to request entry from the host.
- **Owner Visibility and Invitation:** Settings allowing the meet-up host to view entrants and selectively send invitations.
- **User Settings for Friends-Only Meet-ups:** Preferences to trigger notifications only for friends' events.

## Example Scenarios
1. **Open Smoke Circle:** Dave sets his rooftop smoke meet-up to 'Open'. Nearby WoBubatz users, like Sarah, receive notifications and can join without needing approval, fostering a welcoming community vibe.
2. **Approval-Required Session:** Mia organizes a smoke meet-up in the park but prefers vetting attendees. She sets the event to 'Approval Required'. When new users like Tom approach, they're informed to request access, and Mia can approve based on profiles or mutual interests.
3. **Invite-Only Private Gathering:** Liam hosts a private smoke session and sets the meet-up to 'Invite Only'. Only his selected friends, such as Emma, receive details and access, ensuring an intimate and secure environment.
4. **Friends-Only Alerts:** Anna prefers smaller, familiar gatherings. She sets her WoBubatz notifications to 'Friends Only', ensuring she's only alerted to smoke sessions hosted by friends like Jake.
5. **Anonymous Public Participation:** Eric wants to join public smoke meet-ups without revealing his identity. He uses WoBubatzâ€™s anonymity feature, attending under a random alias, and experiences various gatherings like the downtown vape event, maintaining his privacy while exploring different groups.

## Security Measures
WoBubatz is committed to user safety and data security, employing advanced encryption, secure communication channels, and rigorous authentication processes to protect user information and ensure a safe, private meeting environment.
